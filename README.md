Sandbox repo to test and learn GitHub.

# First observations

## Lack of branching with issues
This is really annoying. It was nice in GitLabs when you could craete an issue and then the branch and merge/pull request automatically. This doesn't seem to be possible in GitHub which is a shame.
You can do it with work arounds, but lets not go there...
